# Controlling Context

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Escape | - Interrupt Claude, allowing us to redirect or correct it.<br/>- Also useful to fix issues with # memories. |
| Double-tap Escape | - Rewind the conversation to an earlier point in time.<br/>- Allows you to maintain valuable context. |
| `/compact` | - Summarize the conversation and continue.<br/>- Helps Claude stay focused but remember what it has learned in the current session. |
| `/clear` | - Dumps current conversation history.<br/>- Useful when switching between different tasks. |

By using those techniques strategically, we can keep Claude focused and productive throughout our development workflow.
