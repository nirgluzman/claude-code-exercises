# Claude Code Plan Mode - Spec driven Development

Plan Mode instructs Claude to create a plan by analyzing the codebase with **read-only** operations, perfect for exploring codebases, planning complex changes, or reviewing code safely.

It operates as a special mode where Claude Code can:
- Research and analyze existing codebases without making changes.
- Create comprehensive plans based on gathered contexts.
- Present plans for approval before any implementation.
- Wait for confirmation before proceeding to execution.
